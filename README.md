# Offline-to-Online Reinforcement learning with Directed Exploration Models

## How to run it

Paper results were collected with [MuJoCo 2.1.0](http://www.mujoco.org/) (and [mujoco-py 2.1.2.14](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)) in [OpenAI gym 0.23.1](https://github.com/openai/gym) with the [D4RL datasets](https://github.com/rail-berkeley/d4rl). Networks are trained using [PyTorch 2.0.1](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and Python 3.9.

Run it by:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zherunliu/DEM.git
python run_dem.py
```
